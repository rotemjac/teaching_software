In Python everything is an object including data types and data structures.


The type function 
each object is an instance of a specific class. 
Dictionaries are instances of the dict class.
Lists --> list class, 
Strings --> the str class, 

In Python, a class and a type are the same.


In Python, the constructor method for an object is  __init__() which is called when initializing an object of a class. Because of this, you can use it to pass the initial object attributes.

self 
refers to the current object
