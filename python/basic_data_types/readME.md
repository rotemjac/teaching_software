Python determines the type during runtime, so it doesn't require you to pre-declare a variable's data type. 
It.

This is in contrast to statically typed languages such as Java or C++. 



Strings 
In Python, strings are immutable - once they are assigned to a variable, the value cannot be changed. 

Methods: capitalize,lower, upper, startswith, endswith , strip and more (check here: https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/python_strings.htm)
Formatting: The c-like formatting with % is deprecated. You can use the format() function or use a string interpolation 


Arrays - Lists
Python doesn't have a native array data structure, but it has the list which is much more general and can be used as a multidimensional array quite easily.
Lists are: 
1. heterogeneous, in that they can hold values of different types. In contrast to how arrays are in most languages.
2. mutable, meaning that you can change the values inside of them, adding / removing items.


Booleans
Can be True or False.
Comparison operators: <, <= , >, >= , == , != , is, is not
Logical operators: not, and ,or
Membership operators: in, not in
