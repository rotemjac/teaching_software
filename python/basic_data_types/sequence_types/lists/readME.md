A list is a data structure that holds ordered collections of related data. 

Lists are known as arrays in other programming languages, like Java, C, and C++. Python lists, however, are more flexible and powerful than the traditional arrays of other languages.

Items in a list need not be of the same type.

They are mutable - the elements can be changed.


Built-in methods of list:
list.append(item)
list.extend(iterable)
list.insert(index, item)
list.remove(item)
list.pop([index])
list.clear()
list.index(item [, start [, end]])
list.count(item)
list.sort(key=None, reverse=False)
list.reverse()
list.copy()
