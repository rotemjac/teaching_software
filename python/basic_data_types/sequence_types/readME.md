Python has six built-in types of sequences, but the most common ones 
are lists and tuples, which we would see in this tutorial.

There are certain things you can do with all sequence types. 
These operations include indexing, slicing, adding, multiplying, and checking for membership. 
In addition, Python has built-in functions for finding the length of a sequence and for finding its largest and smallest elements.
