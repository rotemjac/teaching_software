Python has six built-in types of sequences, but the most common ones 
are lists and tuples, which we would see in this tutorial.

There are certain things you can do with all sequence types. 
These operations include indexing, slicing, adding, multiplying, and checking for membership. 
In addition, Python has built-in functions for finding the length of a sequence and for finding its largest and smallest elements.


Strings 
In Python, strings are immutable - once they are assigned to a variable, the value cannot be changed. 

Methods: capitalize,lower, upper, startswith, endswith , strip and more (check here: https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/python_strings.htm)
Formatting: The c-like formatting with % is deprecated. You can use the format() function or use a string interpolation 


Arrays - Lists
Python doesn't have a native array data structure, but it has the list which is much more general and can be used as a multidimensional array quite easily.
Lists are: 
1. heterogeneous, in that they can hold values of different types. In contrast to how arrays are in most languages.
2. mutable, meaning that you can change the values inside of them, adding / removing items.
