Cases where you will prefer tuples over lists: 

Performance - Iterating over tuple is much faster than iterating over list.

They are immutability - the elements can not be changed.

Heterogeneous data types - They are better suited for use with different data types.

Tuples can be used as a key for a dictionary - Because of the immutable nature of tuples.
