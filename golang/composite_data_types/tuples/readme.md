Tuples

1. There is no tuple type in Go.
   But Go has support for certain uses of tuples, like returning from a function without needing to group the various return values into a structure.

2. What is tuple in other languages? For example in python (vs lists):
    Apart from tuples being immutable and lists are mutable there is also a semantic distinction that should guide their usage.
    Tuples are heterogeneous data structures (i.e., their entries have different meanings), while lists are homogeneous sequences
